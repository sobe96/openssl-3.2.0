libssl3 (3.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and DTLS 1.0 work only at security level 0 (it was
  previously allowed at security level 0). If you are still using them, you
  need lower security level (via CipherString = DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=0)
  additionally to the MinProtocol setting.
